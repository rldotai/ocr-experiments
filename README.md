# OCR Experiments

My experiments with some neural OCR models.

The main novelty at the moment is that I'm trying to get everything running in containers so that *other* people might be able to use them as well.
Currently, my interest is mostly a selfish desire to process the reams of notes written in the course of [my research](https://rl.ai/pages/research/), rather than anything more cutting edge.
However, if that sounds like the sort of thing that might be useful to you, I've created a few utilities [in my `pdf-stuff` repo](https://github.com/rldotai/pdf-stuff) which might be of interest.
